# Community Datasets

Pre-processed data for local industry levels (employment, establishments, payroll).

Prior to GitHub Actions, another approach was the [Public Tree Map Pipeline](https://github.com/Public-Tree-Map/public-tree-map-data-pipeline).

How to process zipcodes for testing:
1) Access the single_zipcode.py file.
2) Select which NAICS levels you want by modifying the list "inds".
3) Run the function with desired incode as your parameter. This input should be a string, and contain five characters. Ex: '98006', '30308', '00501'
