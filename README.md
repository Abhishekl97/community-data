# Community Datasets

Pre-processed state, county and zipcode data for the [model.earth](https://model.earth) project.  

Most data currently resides in our [community-data/us/state](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/us/state) subfolders.  



We're using Github Actions. Here are our [Github&nbsp;Actions&nbsp;samples](https://model.earth/community/projects/#github-actions).
