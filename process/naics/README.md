# Processing NAICS by Zip Code

[View Data by Zip](https://model.earth/zip/io/#zip=30318)
[Process Timelines](/data-pipeline/timelines/prep/all)

### NAICS zip code files

Processed using <b>split\_zip\_data.py</b> in the current folder.
Creates files for naics levels 2,4 and 6 in "zips" subfolder.

Bug: Payroll column is mostly 0. Why do some get populated? [Example](https://github.com/ModelEarth/community-data/tree/master/us/zipcodes/naics/5/3/5/2/1)

The columns from the census naics zip file are:
Zip Naics Establishments Employees Payroll 

Population and Sqmiles would be good to add from another source.

The file title format contains naics2, naics4 or naics6 and the year:
zipcode53521-census-naics6-2020.csv

# Industries by Zip Code (ZCTA)

Benjamin Liu processed [naics by zip code](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/process/naics). (Payroll is mostly 0 in these.)

We're pulling [zip demographic data](../../zip/io/) into a json file for each zip code from [uszipcode.readthedocs.io](https://uszipcode.readthedocs.io/01-Tutorial/index.html).  

[Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/data/) also provides annual industry data by zip code.

Here's a example of [clustering zip code data for multiple parameters](../../community/zip/leaflet/#columns=JobsAgriculture:50;JobsManufacturing:50).  


## State Centroids

Script for generating state centroids from TIGER data resides in:  
[community-data/us/](/community-data/us/) and county/zip centroids [community/info/rstudio](/community/info/rstudio)


## Older - ZIP Code Industries from BEA Spreadsheets


Here's a [prep all](/community/prep/all/) script with industries by zip code from spreadsheets with a random forest applied. 


<b>Industry Employment Levels</b><br>

Script resides in prep/industries/source

To run:  
sqlite3 industry.db < industry.SQL.txt > industry.OUT.txt  
First change the year in industry.SQL.txt  

### Data Sources

Due to the delay of 2017 Economic Census, the 2017 zip data became available in December of 2019. (The above script has not yet been updated and run for the 2017 data.)  
<!--
Companies per industry within each zipcode. Normally these are available annually at the end April, but the [ 2019 release will be in November and December](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/news-updates/updates/dec-2018.html) due to the delay of 2017 Economic Census.
